# Guidance and organization of the seminar

Materials in the repository consist of three parts, namely `Outline` (a brief slide of outline to be presented, stressing the key points and framework), `Materials` (a list of materials on the topics, with an introduction of the assignment), `Assignment` (several exercises and small projects to be finished on the topic).

Before the material due, person responsible for the topic should:
- Upload, or say push, a source file of a slide of outline. The outline should
cover fundamental ideas of the topic and should avoid aimless, intensive enumeration.
- Upload, or say push, a source file of a list of materials related to
the topic. The list of materials should contain following parts:
    - Hints for configurations and installations.
    - A list of resources related to the topic.
    - A list of assignment with a brief description, marked with `\textbf{(Required)}` and
    `\textbf{(Optional)}`. It is recommended that the assignment composed
    of several small, practical projects, and ``short questions'' emphasizing
    details should be avoided, especially multiple choices and blank filling.
    Background of required assignments should be explained. It is best to
    attach the solution, with automatic testing tools if possible.
- Set an issue in the original seminar repository to collect suggestions
on the topics. The title should be `Week <#week> --- <title>`.

Before the seminar or a specified due, everyone attending the seminar should:
- Choose some resource to read and learn about the topic.
- Finish the required part of assignment.

In the seminar, person responsible for the topic should:
- Give a brief presentation on the outline of the topic for about 30 minutes unless otherwise specified. Questions are
not allowed during the presentation due to limited time.
- Hold discussion around the topic.
